						<h2>Step 1</h2>
						<p>Changing strings requires quite a bit of space and a ton of tuning, therefore before you begin, please find a suitable place to work.</p>
						<p>Although it is possible to change guitar strings without any tools at all, there are a few utilities that can drastically speed up the process. These are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>a guitar tuner,</li>
							<li>wire cutters,</li>
							<li>a string winder,</li>
							<li>and of course, new strings.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

						<h2>Step 2</h2>
						<p>Firstly, ensure that your guitar is in a stable position and remove the old strings. The easiest way to remove strings is to loosen the string a little bit, then cut it near the midpoint of the guitar with wire cutters.</p>

						<h2>Step 3</h2>
						<p>Then remove the old string by unwinding it from the headstock post and unthreading it through the back of the body.</p>
					</div>

						<h2>Step 4</h2>
						<p>Next, you will have to thread the new guitar string through the back of the body or a tailpiece. Then align the hole in the headstock post with the neck and thread the string through. Make sure to leave some slack so that the string can wind around the post 2-3 times.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<img src="assets/restringing/step5.jpg" alt="A picture of a guitar machine head being wound using a string winder." class="u-full-width">
						<h2>Step 5</h2>
						<p>Start winding the string, this can be done by hand or with the string winder, make sure that you wind the sting on the inner side of the headstock. Also, while you’re winding it put pressure on the string to pull it down so that it doesn’t wind over itself. Do not overwind the string, this can cause unnecessary tension which can damage your guitar or snap the string.</p>
						<p>Once you do that, tune the string (<a class="link" href="guidesTuning.php">read the tuning guide</a>) and repeat for the next strings. If you’re replacing all of the strings you might want to remove all of them at once and then clean the guitar, as it is easier to do so without the strings.</p>
						<p>The new strings will take a while to settle in therefore you should retune them every 5 minutes (or as soon as you notice that they sound off) until they settle in.</p>
