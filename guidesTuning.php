				<p>The “normal” tuning of a guitar is known as the E standard tuning. It consists of the notes E2, A2, D3, G3, B3 and E4. You can remember this with phrases such as “Eddie Ate Dynamite, Good Bye Eddie” or “Elephants And Donkeys Grow Big Ears”.</p>
				<p>Experienced guitar players can often tune their guitars by ear, however if you can’t do that yet you can easily tune a guitar using an electronic tuner or a tuner app (I personally use the latter).</p>
				<p>To start tuning your guitar, power on your tuner or launch the app. Then strum the low E string (when referring to the strings, the word “low” means low pitch not the lowest to the ground, so strum the thickest string). Look at your tuner and tighten or loosen the string accordingly using the machine heads on the headstock.</p>
